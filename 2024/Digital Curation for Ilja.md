About the pitfalls of trying to make (research) data openly available (although we could discuss other potential topics).

I think for your contribution an ethics angle might be something to consider. To get students to think about what the (ethical) limits are of "keeping everything in a digital archive".

The conversation we had back when about how archaeology "donâ€™t play like that" might be something for students to sink their teeth in.

My initial thoughts:

- About the practical reality of open science infrastructure, which involves ethics too, to an extent
- Ethics is especially relevant to making cultural heritage data available
    - Precise geospatial coordinates
    - Dealing with descendent communities
    - Ensuring authenticity, disclosing limitations and conflicts of interest (thinking of the Petra arch, the Getty trust)
- Epistemic diversity, the need to quantize and render objective
- The implication that things must be referencable and auditable, rather than ephemeral, informal and consensus-driven
- Are people actually using these things? In ways that actually make a meaningful difference in relation to established norms?
- On the end-user perspective, the work involved in making open data useful, and the replacement of a discursive collaborative experience with a transactional exchange of structured information
- Carbon emissions? AI? Commercial appropriation?

1. Introduce myself
    - My background as an archaeology, technologist, basis in digital methods and data work
    - My role as archaeological database manager, revelation it's all about people
    - Make some amiable remark about so many archaeologists in ischools these days
1. Lead into my key concern
    - Data-sharing is communication and collaboration, not just uploading spreadsheets
    - In the words of my supervisor (in context of digital curation specifically), [the thing about reconciliation]
    - So formal data are one aspect of data-sharing, alongside less formal means of establishing communal understanding across research contexts (e.g. coffee shop conversations, email threads, etc)
    - If just uploading spreadsheets without adequate contextualizing info, this opens the door for misuse of data, in either epistemic or ethical uses of the term "misuse"
    - Making data available in an archive inherently involves loss of control, particularly by stakeholders who are most familiar with the context of the data's creation and who created them with specific intent
2. Get into dissertation stuff
    - With this problem in mind, I sought to articulate these tensions between formal and informal aspects of scientific communication and their roles in the constitution and validation of scientific knowledge
    - So I went out and observed archaeologists at work, while interviewing them about what they were doing, and examining the documents they produced
    - The intent was to ascertain how people working with various tools, with different backgrounds etc contributed to a communal data stream, and how this was mediated through combined social and technical apparatus
    - Overall, I found that the management of data parallelled, and in fact depended on the management of people, and that data's authoritative character was wrapped up in mechanisms of control
3. Basically summarize the [InformalMedia](papers/InformalMedia/InformalMedia.md) paper
    - Compare recording sheets and field journals
    - Participating in information commons
    - Some information gets lost or is ignored altogether when brought into digital systems
    - The role of digital repositories as stabilizing devices, and the attitudes and behaviours of the people who translate info to digital systems
1. Relate to data reuse and open science
    - So what does this have to do with digital archives?
    - In looking at data-sharing as a collaborative experience, I framed data-sharing via the web as merely the extension of a project's membership beyond its original boundaries
    - The collaborative commitments, or the norms and expectations that govern how scientists should relate with each other, are still in flux, but in general -- and in spite of the growing open science movement -- they remain largely unchanged
    - Convey the findings of the [openarchaeo-collaboration](papers/openarchaeo-collaboration/openarchaeo-collaboration%20notes.md) paper, which demonstrate the lack of dramatic shift
    - Share some preliminary findings re: [DataPapers-Citations](papers/DataPapers-Citations/DataPapers-Citations.md)
    - This is not a bad thing though! It simply reveals the actual, and perhaps even natural or intuitive role that data papers have in archaeological knowledge production
2. Relate to broader concerns
    - So all in all, my work demonstrates what happens when archaeologists are asked to relinquish control over the fruits of their labour
    - Data are not ambivalent, are created with intent, and bear limitations owing to the circumstances of their creation
    - This reality runs counter to the open science movement's fundamental misunderstanding of data and their role in the constitution of knowledge, i.e. as disembodied corpuscular entities that can be recombined to yield novel results
    - And, on an intuitive level, all scientists with adequate experience collecting and working with data know this, which produces a tangible anxiety when they are forced to present their data as purely objective and unquestionable representations of reality
    - But this is a dishonest message to convey, given that scientists are just improvizing their way to more-or-less stable knowledge

Notes for meeting with Ilja -- September 19

- What do you mean by ethics, in terms of "ethical limits" of maintaining digital archives?
- How much time would I have?
- Do you want me to just lecture, or do some activity too?
- It is ok that this is just a recollection of an experience, and not really deeply based in theory?
- 


- Framing in terms of meeting the needs of designated communities, and practical challenges of doing this
-
