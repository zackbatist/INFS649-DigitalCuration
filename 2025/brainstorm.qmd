Not all data are the same, not all science is the same.

The lecture will be about open data and presumptions about dataâ€™s role in scientific knowledge production.
Breaking down the mono-myth of data and "just-so" stories.

Examples:

- OAIS origins with space tech, as per neighbours story, and as further expanded upon in conversation at MATC.
- ADS and whaling data.
- CRANE and palaeo-environment reconstruction
- That one post about open gov data
