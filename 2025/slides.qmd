How do researchers _actually_ engage with open science practices, principles and tooling?

</br>vs.</br></br>

How advocates claim science works and _should_ work.


How we think about data and data's role in knowledge production is central to this discussion.

:::

# About me
## About me

- How does open science reconfigure --- _or attempt to reconfigure_ --- collaborative experiences?
- What values are associated with open science, and how do they intersect with scientists actual needs and desires?

<hr>

- [Currently:]{.underline} Technical and administrative systems that scaffold the Covid Immunity Task Force Databank
- [Previously:]{.underline} Data work in archaeology, especially data sharing, integration and reuse
- [Also:]{.underline} Collaborative software development practices

::: {.notes}
I take the view that data sharing is primarily a social, rather than merely technical experience, and should be treated as such.

# What are data?
## What are data?

1. Descriptive accounts of observed phenomenon
2. Evidence that forms the basis of a claim
3. Means of communicating observations from one set of circumstances to another

## What are data?
1. [Descriptive accounts of observed phenomenon]{.mark}
2. [Evidence that forms the basis of a claim]{.mark}
3. Means of communicating observations from one set of circumstances to another

<hr>

- Data are fixed and stable
- Data are generated prior to and separate from analysis
- Selected data models are a "natural" fit

::: {.notes}
This imbues data with an aura of authority, stability, and truthfulness.

And also supports a particular approach of sharing data over the web.

If data are all reflections of reality, then if we get all those records together we can learn more about the world!
Yes, but...
The data models are all different.
The decisions and actions that led to the creation of each dataset may not be compatible (a) with each other and (b) with the new analytical goals.

Example

## What are data?
1. Descriptive accounts of observed phenomenon
2. Evidence that forms the basis of a claim
3. [Means of communicating observations from one set of circumstances to another]{.mark}

<hr>

Records created under specific circumstances,
for targeted purposes,
and informed by partial background knowledge

Example: DObsiSS

# How open science tends to imagine data
## The Open Data Imaginary
- Non-material, non-political (politics relates to materiality in that different people can participate based on differential access to material resources)
- Non-social (emerges from nature, rather than from people)
- Infinitely re-configurable

---

None of this is true.

# Critique of all that
